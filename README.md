# Minecraft Servers List - Lite Version

Hello everyone! I've created this lite version of the [Minecraft Servers List](https://codecanyon.net/item/minecraft-servers-list/4062368&ref=grohsfabian) Script that doesn't require a lot of server power and also it is easy to maintain. 

This code is free for everybody to use for personal purposes. It is strictly prohibited to resell any part of the code.
